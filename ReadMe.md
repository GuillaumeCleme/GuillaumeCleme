## Interests

I enjoy spending time in nature, hiking, camping, climbing mountains, driving around in my Jeep, and staying active. When relaxing, I can also be found reading business, finance, and technology books while enjoying the darkest coffee available.

From open source contributions to software related business ventures, I also like to keep my technical skills sharp and apply a lot of my real-world experience to personal projects. I am known for getting stuff done, always looking for optimizations, being very passionate, and sometimes using a colorful language.
